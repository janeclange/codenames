Installation:

1. Clone this repo
2. `pip install reqirements.txt`
3. download the necessary word embeddings:
 

Step 1: borrow scaffolding code from an existing codenames paper divyakoyy/codenames \\

Step 2: write a basic objective function based on 1 similarity scoring function that takes a set of your cards and a set of opponent cards and evaluates how strong a given clue word is \\

Step 3: replace the single-embedding similarity with max similarity over several embeddings \\

codewords_simplified contains only words that are present in GoogleNews set
